                <h1>Meet Muhsinah</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello! I’m Alaran Muhsinah Moninuola, a recent Food Technology graduate with a growing passion for web development, quality control, and tech-driven problem solving. My background blends scientific precision with creative curiosity, which reflects in the way I approach both food systems and code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy reading (mostly fiction), and I'm a proud member of the "I could eat rice every day" club. While I sometimes procrastinate (who doesn’t?), I take great pride in delivering my work with attention and care. Responsibility is a value I carry in everything I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This portfolio reflects my journey so far — bridging science, sustainability, and software. I’m excited to keep building and growing.
                </p>

                <h1>Interests</h1>
                
                <h3>Food Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm deeply interested in food technology; especially in quality control, post-harvest loss prevention, sustainability, and edible films. These interests stem from a desire to solve real-world problems in food systems, reduce waste, and improve food packaging through innovative and sustainable solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time as a Food Science and Technology student, I gained hands-on experience during my industrial training, working on the quality testing of soft drinks, preforms, and closures. My final-year project focused on creating edible film from agricultural waste, blending innovation with environmental consciousness. That project was a defining moment for me and sparked a deeper commitment to sustainability in food science.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm also exploring web development — both frontend and backend — through a structured scholarship program by Power Learn Project (PLP). My curiosity about how systems and tools function under the hood is what initially drew me into programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently learning Python and Django, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the aim of building practical, scalable applications. I'm still early in the journey, but I'm committed to continuous learning and eager to build real-world projects that make a difference.
